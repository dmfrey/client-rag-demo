#
# Options:
#   --with-batch      also deploy the optional batch job (manifest-batch.yml)
#   --without-batch   do not, even if deploy-batch is true in vars.yml
#   --dry-run         do everything except the cf push, and print what would be pushed
#

# second step only once that has succeeded - by then the backend is running and has migrated the
# database, and sharepoint-batch must never run against a database the backend has not migrated
