# Does nothing (and says so) when vision-service is empty in vars.yml. deploy.sh runs this for you
# after the push, so you normally only run it by hand to add vision to an already-deployed system.
# If the executable bit was lost in transit, run it as `bash enable-vision.sh`.
#
# A CF manifest cannot bind a service conditionally, so this is done with cf commands instead of in
# manifest.yml: it binds the service and sets APP_GENAI_VISION_SERVICE, which is what switches the
# feature on (without that setting the apps have no vision model and image/scanned files simply fail
# ingestion with a clear message). `cf push` keeps both, so later deploys do not undo it.
#
# To turn it off again:
#   cf unset-env client-rag-demo-backend APP_GENAI_VISION_SERVICE && cf unbind-service client-rag-demo-backend <service>
#   (same for client-rag-demo-sharepoint-batch), then restart the backend.
